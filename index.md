### Telecome Churn Prediction

The primary goal of this project is to predict customer churnâ€”whether a customer will leave the telecom provider (churn) or continue using the service. Predicting churn allows the company to retain customers by taking proactive steps to improve their satisfaction and engagement.

This project contains information about various risk factors related to companies and aims to predict the likelihood of bankruptcy based on these factors. Each row represents a company with specific levels of risk in different areas, and the `class` column indicates whether the company is at risk of bankruptcy. The values in the dataset are categorized as follows:

- `1` represents a high risk.
- `0.5` represents a moderate risk.
- `0` represents a low risk.
